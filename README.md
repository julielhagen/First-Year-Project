# Questions

# General
How do we tacke more skin lesions i one photo?
Will we receive masks with more than one lesion in the test set?

# Features?
How can we mesure diameter?

Can we use the data in the csv or should we assume that we only have the pictures and no further data, such as age, diameter, etc.?

How are we supposed to use measure of areal and perimeter? These measures depends on how the picture is taken, so can we compare them for different pictures?

What do we do, when the lesions are spread out on multiple areas of the skin? (multiple lesions in one mask)?
