# Questions

# General
How do we tacke more skin lesions i one photo? Will we receive masks with more than one lesion in the test set?

Our current fucntion for loading in the images makes the RGB values a float between [0: 1]. Is this a problem?

Where in the process should we use PCA? Should we use it in combination with or before the other methods for featre extraction?

# Features?
How can we mesure diameter?

Can we use the data in the csv or should we assume that we only have the pictures and no further data, such as age, diameter, etc.?

How are we supposed to use measure of areal and perimeter? These measures depends on how the picture is taken, so can we compare them for different pictures?
