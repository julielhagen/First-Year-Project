## :camera Skin Lesion Classification

### About

Project for skin lesion classification, attempting to predict diagnoses as either cancerous or non-cancerous. The main method used to accomplish this is image classification, employing methods from scikit-learn and scikit-image. However, a linear regression model based on image metadata is also included.

This is a working repository, and is essentially a copy of the repository found at https://github.com/sanderengel/fyp2023, the only difference being that this repository includes all the images and masks used to extract features. For more information, see the above repository link.
